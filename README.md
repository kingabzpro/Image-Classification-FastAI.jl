# Image-Classification-FastAI.jl

In this project, we are going to use the fastai library to train on the [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/) dataset and evaluate our ResNet model. The imagenette2-160 dataset is from the fastai dataset repository (https://course.fast.ai/datasets) that contains smaller size images of the things around us which range from animals to cars. The ResNet-18 model architecture is available at [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf). We won't be going deep into the dataset or how model architecture works, instead, we will be focusing on how fastai.jl has made deep learning easy.
